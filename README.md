# hi, i'm Alex Lucena :relaxed:

I've been an itinerant dev-of-many-trades for a decent stretch of time. Through much of that time, I didn't expect that my experience with, and contributions to, off-the-clock software projects would be something I would want to be formalized enough to be presented publicly and professionally. To my recent surprise, my on-the-clock work has lately required me to actively collaborate with people leading exciting open-source projects. For this reason, I figured I'd set up a proper github to track and represent that work clean and proper... without the years of frenetic micro-apps and game mods bogging it down!

In that spirit, I'll be using this account & this readme to track technologies and topics I'm active or interested in, and take the chance to talk about them more fully and openly than I'd get to in a resume's SKILLS bulleted list, for example : )

## :milky_way: techs i've grown to love and rely on

dotnet

blazor

graphql

## :muscle: stuff i'm putting work into

ux research

typescript

vuejs

## üê≤ crouching hobbies, hidden interests

## :pensive: forlorn techs of career's past that i'd like to keep up with
